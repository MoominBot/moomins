Later we meet the wonderful psychological study of the \"Fillyjonk Who Believed In Disasters\" in Tales from Moominvalley. Not a single moment of fantasy or joy, only duties and discipline; she is an extremely methodical person tied down with principles and has a deep rooted belief in prestige and tradition. Nevertheless, after a catastrophe, The Fillyjonk can be freed from the trammels of social expectation and can discover the joys of freedom, irrationality and self-expression. Deep inside she has had a wish to live freely as the Moomin family does, without any worries. Fillyjonks resemble humanoid rodents; they are tall and thin, with long muzzles and raccoon-like rings around their eyes."

Later on, he finds a new purpose: to collect plants. In Finn Family Moomintroll, \"un-Hemulenish\" (ohemul) contains a sense of \"unwarranted, unjustified\"."

        description: `In the cartoon strip Moomintroll finds himself beset by endless problems. He is a "moomin" - a little white troll with a hippopotamus-like big round snout.
Moomin is very close with Snorkmaiden. They have a very sweet and romantic relationship in the early books. However, later on he and Snorkmaiden are not seen together as often and after 'Moominland Midwinter' Moomin refers to Snorkmaiden as a friend. How their relationship is portrayed varies between adaptations. For example, the 1990 animated series shows him consistently, if shyly, returning her affections.
His best friend is Snufkin. Snufkin is inspired by Atos Wirtanen, Tove Jansson's close friend and at one point, fiancé. Moomintroll is also an author avatar for Jansson, meaning the two characters were based on real-life lovers. Because of this real-life parallel, their relationship is sometimes examined in the context of queer theory.
Moomintroll was initially called "snork". Jansson described him as her alter ego. The character has a mostly positive reception from critics.
The asteroid 58345 Moomintroll was named in his honor.`
